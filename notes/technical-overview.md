The **Python_Reference** repo is a collection of essential algorithms and data structures coded in Python. It's aimed at developers needing quick access to classic algorithms, covering:

- **Sorting:** insertion, selection, merge, quick, shell, bubble.
- **Searching:** sequential, ordered sequential, binary (both iterative and recursive).
- **Data Structures:** stacks, queues, linked lists (single and circular), trees (binary, AVL), heaps.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Prim's MST with different implementations.
- **Utilities:** palindrome checker, list summation, Sierpinski triangle.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/Python_Reference.git
   cd Python_Reference
   ```
2. **Run examples directly, like this:**
   ```bash
   python shell_sort.py
   ```

### Gotchas

- Most scripts have a `__main__` block for easy execution.
- This is mainly a personal reference; contributions are limited. Keep that in mind if you plan to use or extend it.
